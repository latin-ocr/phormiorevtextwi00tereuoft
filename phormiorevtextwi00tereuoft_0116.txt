the stage before time’. The didascalia of Hec. as once read
stated it to have been acted A. u. 594 (Β. c. 160) at the funeral
games of L. Aemilius Paullus: whilst the Phormio came out
Β. c. 161. But this refers to the second (and unsuccessful)
attempt, the first having taken place A. u. 589 (Β. c. 166).

motus loco. Locus may be a metaphor from military
matters, ‘ driven off the field'. Hor. Ep. 2. 2. 30 loco deiecit,
which OreHi explains by ⁴ castello depulit’. Forcell. explains
it as a figure from gladiators or wrestlers. where he who causes
his adversary to shift his ground is sure of an easy vietum
which is not so good. Locus seems also to have been used as
a t. t.=‘the stage’. Cf. Verg. Aen. 7. 332 Ne noster honos
infractaue cedat Fama loco. ’

33. actoris uirtus. It was excellent policy for Terence

uirtus may refer (1) to the eoecellernce of the acting, or (2)
to the pluck with which Ambivius again and again tried to win
the favour of the people. The connexion with uir perhaps
points to this signification.

34. adiutansssadiuuans. Cf. supr. 7, note.

Dauos is a πρόσωπον προτατικόν, brought on merely to intro-
duce the play, and coming on only in the vrporacns=that part
of a play before action begins, opposed to ἐπίτασις and κατα-
στροφή. Don. to Andr. 1.

35. summus. ‘ My most intimate friend '.. It means this
even without amicus. Eun. 271 summum suom. Of. infr. 1049,
Ad 352, Nam is nostro Simulo suit summus.

popularis. Perhaps ‘ fellow-countryman’.. If Davus:
Dacus, the Daci >and Getae being conterminous, both might be
looked on as Thracians by Romans not too strict about their
geography. Cic. ad Att. 10. 1. 2, Eyo uero Solonis popularis,
tui, ut puto etiam mei, legem neyleyam. The lexicons take it
= ‘ fellow-slave ’, comparing populares coniurationis Sallust
Catil. 24. Ο. sceleris ib. 22. But in these cases the qualifying
genitive affects the meaning.
