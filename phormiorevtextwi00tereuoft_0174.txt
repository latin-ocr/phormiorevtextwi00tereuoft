884 sqq. Faernus first made this a separate scene3 no

doubt rightly.

⁷ 885. eludendi occasiost, διο. Notice the apparent change
in construction: the gerund is strictly active in sense and
equivalent to an inf. Madv. ς 419. For the inf. see Brix on
Plaut. Capt. 423. Phaedria would be anxious how to get back
money to repay the old men. See 535- supr.

888, 9. ing-ratiis, διο. ‘This same money,.given as it has
been, shall continue hie, will they 11111 they: the way to enforce
this Ι have discovered by the course of events '. Fen ut Dz.
suggests quod, which gimplifies the construction. The dis-
covery of :Chremes’ intrigue puts· the old men-in Phormio’s
power.

890. See above 51, on the use 01 maske.

891. angiportum, ‘iter compendiariam in oppido ⁹. Fest.

893. :non eo.. ‘ Ι (10 not mean to go ’.

896. estne ita, διο. In the MSS. this verse follows 905,

well, placed it at the beginning of the scene after 893.

estne [ea]. Ea which Parry says is contained in all MSS.
is not found in one of Umpf.’s. . -

898. dilapidat, ‘ demolish ’, ‘to make ducks and drakes of’,
ἅπαξ My„ though Cicero, or rather Octavianus, said of Antony,
publicam dilapidat pecuniam. [Wagner is not consistent with
himself ς if he followed his own rule of implicit obedience ‘ to
the authority of the best MS) he would have read tractent,
supr. 17.]

903. quod recepissem semel. ‘What Ι had once engaged
to do ’. Of. Heaut. 1056 ad me recipio .· faciet. ’

904. heus, usually (like οὗτος) a cry to call attention; here

{lggr'ng S{gzuld not be as good as his word. Tr. *Hark yel'

911. qui erit rumor, ὣς. 01. supr. 724, Tho line is

prettier if we omit populi and read id si fecem.

913. nunc eam extrudi. This reading may have arisen ἡ

from mistake as to the meaning of uiduam. But more proba·
