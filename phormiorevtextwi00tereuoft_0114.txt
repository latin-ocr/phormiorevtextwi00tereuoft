‘patientia paene Christiana' which displeased Bentley. Rather

‘tired of him I get to my real point ’. Bentl.’smm=-‡2mtit which

rewrites the passage is too violent, but makes good sense.
‘Then will I make an end of speaking concerning' him, when

he shall, &03 Most modern texts read a query with Stalibaum,
‘Shall 1’ be the first to make peace?‘

quom concessive and adversative (as Dziatzko says) in
Plautus are construed with the Indicative‚ in Terence with Iud.
and Conjunctive. Cf. Eun. 243 uii quom est. Ad. 166 indignis

24. nouam. Note that this word can be applied to the
play though but an adaptation : it could be applied even to the
Hecyra on· its third representation [Hec. prol, 5 Nunc haec
plane est pro uouaJ. A good example of the use of the word
nouus as opposed* to recens is given in these places, and also infr.
245 Ne quid horum umquam accidat animo nouom. [A curious
fflustration of the question occurs in the action for dramatic
libel brought by Mr Reece against the Theatre newspaper,
reported m the papers of February 21‚1879. Mr Tom Taylor
said,‘ There was nothing wrong in cal’ling an adaptation new.
There was a recognised distinction—between new—and new
and original. He had written about ten adaptatione, and no γ
doubt some of these had been described as new ’.]

25. Epidicazomenos. See note on Didascalia.

26. Graeci, Latini nominant. Bentl. Id uero miraculi
instar est, si iam Latini nominant Phormionem, priusquam acta

, fuerit, priusquam eam coqnouerint'. So he reads Graece—

Latine hic (4 n.) Phormionem nominat. This is perhaps better .
{latim but not what Ter. wrote. He quotes several passages

show (1) that Graece Latine is better than Graeci, &cd (2)
that poets named their own plays, e. g. Plaut. As. 12 Huic
nomeu Graece Ouayo est fabulae. Demophilus scripsit Maccius
uortit Barbare; Asinariam uolt esse si per uos licet. Cas. 31· 3
Mero. 10; Poen. 533 Trin. 18-21 [which however is perhaps
not genuine, Liebig de proll. Ter. et Plaut. p. 39].

” 27. primas parus aget, 1.0. 110 was to be protaqonist.
Owing to the infrequent use of masks on the early Roman
stage it was not possible (as it was at Athens) for one actor to
take many parts. Doubtless that of Phormio was taken by
L. Ambivius Turpio at the first representation, by L. Atilius of
Praeneste at a later revival. With respect to the use of maske ·
