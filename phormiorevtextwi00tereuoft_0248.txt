Sir T. D. AcLANn. Bart, says of this boola—“1 think the “School
Cookery Book ’² the best cheap manual which Ι have seen on the subject.
Ι hope teachers will welcome it. But it seems to me likely to be even
more useful for domestic purposes in all ranks short of those sei-ved by
professed cooks. The receipts are numerous and preci-se, the explana·
tion of principles clear. The Chapters on the adaptauon of food to
varying circumstances, age, climate, employment‚ health, and on iufants’
sood, seem to me' excellent.”
