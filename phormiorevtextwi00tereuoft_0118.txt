82 «P. TERENTJ PHOBMIO.

It is probable that Ter. has mixed up Greek and Roman
customs with regard both to slaves and the presente. A Greek
slave was often‘hired out, and was :allowed to work on his own
account, ‘pay'ing his master a fixed sum whatever his gains—as
some cabmen now. -

43. demensum is·of course ‘that which was measured out’,
from the supine stem of demetior, having nothing immediately
to do with men-§is a month, from which it is sometimes ab·

surdly derived. Yet the two words are doubtless connected.
cf. Gk. μὴν. Curtius Grundz. d. G. e. 471.

44. defrudans. Ritschl prefers both frudo and defrudo,
ad Trin. 413. Here A and four others of Umpfenbaoh’s MSS.
have -u-: at Tr. 1. c. codd. have --au-‚ Ritschl himself substi-

tuting frudaui. Cf. the corresponding forms 'in causa, αοσῑιεος
claudo, cludo. Gorssen Ausspr. 1. 660 sq. Roby ἓ 250. ’

, genium. Root GEN (as in γίγνομαι, genus, ἄτα). A man’s
{own sels: and hence in the popular imagination a kind of
‘guardian angel [Hor. Ep. 1. 7. 94 Scit qenins, &c.]‚ the com-
‚panion of his sorrows and joys from the cradle to the grave.
{Hence to act liberally or niggardly to the genius is equivalent
§to sels-gratification or sels-denial. Plaut. Tmc. 1. 2. 8 Isti qui

JIt’is the peculiar bent of mind which gives each mam his
’τ separate identity. ' The following passages illustrate the point.

conpersit. Better form than comparsit. Parsit occurs
Nov. 78; Ribbeck's Com. Fr. p. 266 ; parauit Naev. 69.. ib.

46. quanto labore partum. Note the omission of the
copula. sit. The expression comes very near to being ·an ex-
clamation. Dziatzko compares infr. 84, 256, 264, 611, 612.

47. ferietur munere. The expression does not occur
elsewhere. [It is possibly *a m'istranslation of Hdt. 8. 5
πληγέντες δώροισι(;1)1·ἰῖ)θᾶ·) connected with the use of πλήσσομαι
of being smitten with misfortune, e.g. Hdt. 1. 43 συμφορῇ
πεπληγμένοι] Of. Hor. S. 2. 1. 60 0 puer ut sis Vitalis metuo
et maiorum ne quis amicus Fr'iyore te feriat. Paley on Prop.
4. 3. 50; 5. 44 Cum ferit astutos comica moecha Getas. Plaut.
Trin. 247 it means little more than cheat. cf. the metaphoric
use of deuerberasse infr. 327 ς of mactare, 1028·; of optundere
5153 of ὑπωπιάζειν S. Luke xviii. 5.
