at the end of the play is induced by his good-nature to

Beyond this, it is hard to take exception to the character-
painting of Terence: Diderot, indeed, considers the
old man in the Heautontimorumenos as overdrawn z·—
no one could be so utter a monomaniac or so distress

not always of low birth and the particular class de-
picted in Terence is that of the master's confidant.

which pervades the comedies, and in the representa-
tion οἱ slave life a hint of something still higher, an
inducement to gentleness and humanity. But in the
main the tendency, we cannot but sear, was downwards
rather than upwards 3 vice is there though it is more
refined than that to which the Romans were as yet
