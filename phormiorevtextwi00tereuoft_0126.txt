90. opperiri dum iret. Roby, ἓξ 1663, 1664. Dum w. subi»
present and imperfect, to express an event expected or purposed,
may be translated into English by using ‘ shall '‚ ‘should ’,
‘can ’, ‘could’, or a periphrasis, e. g. Cic. ad Att. 7. 1. 4 Ex-
pecta, amabo te, dum Atticum conueniam, ‘to allow of my
meeting A! Dum=‘ until' of a simple expression of fact
usually takes the present indicative. Plaut. Most. 683 Epo hic
tantisper, dum eoois, te opperiar foris.

91. ‹ 1111. The locative of ille used adverbially. Don. ‘illi
pro ibi, ut illi mea tristia fata', Verg. Aen. 2. 548 (where it is
dat. after narrare). So isti (Plana), illi-c, isti-c, izi-c, pereyo-23,
temperi, dcc. Roby, Bk. 11. ch. xv. p. 177, Public Sohool

interuenit. Ter. here quits his original. Apollodorus
makes the barber himself enter and say that he has been cut-
ting the girl's hair for her mourning‚ which (as Don.) would
offend Roman sentiment. For Greeks used to crop (κείρεσθαι)
their hair, Romans to let it grow, inf. 106 capillus passus,
Liv. 1. 26 soluit crines, 6. 16 multos mortales capillum ac
barbam promisisse.

92.v mirarier. ‘We fell to wondering'. Roby, §g 614,
615, suggests that this form of the infinitivo arose thus: the
ordinary passive suffix r, in the form er, was added to the
active inf., whose final ἒ took the form of i before er. Then
the r would be dropt because of its ill sound after another r
(Roby‚ ξ 185) and ie contracted to i. Thus amare-er, amar-ier,
amaria, amari. This form in -ier is occasionally found in poets
of the classical period, e.g. Verg. Aen. 11. 242 farier ,· Hor.
Odes, 4, 11, 8 sparyier.

93. rogamus quid. sit, ‘ We ask what's to do '.

94. paupertas uisumst. The participle is attracted into
agreement with the predicate. Such sentences as Quas ,ceritis
uestes sordida lana fuit, Ov. A. A. 3. 222, are on the same
principle. Bentley disliking the constr. read with Priscian,
2, p. 94 uisa est, which is an obvious correction.

95. hic uiciniae. ‘ Hard by here ’. These words may
be (1) locatives in apposition with each other, or (2), as the
analogy of Andr. 70 huc uiciniae makes almost certain, uiciniae
is a genitive dependent on hic. Cf. Roby, ἐξ 1091, 1092, 1299.
