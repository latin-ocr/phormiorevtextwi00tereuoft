INTRODUCTION. ix

Roman literature it is successful imitation rather than
any new glory of creation which forms the boast of
those authors whom we account the greatest. Tragedy
is not the expression of the deep and solemn vein
which runs through all the history of Rome z comedy—

‘at least, comedy of the highest sort—is not a reflex of

the national life. Catullus is dubbed ‘doctus‚' the techni-
cal epithet for one skilled in Greek lore. Vergil⁶ boasts
that he has sung Hesiod in Roman citieS, and Horace
tunes to native strings the songs of another land.
There is no reason to be astonished at this 3 it is only
to say that a nation whose genius prompted deeds of
war, conquest, legislation and administrative power,

⁴whose constructive and artistic faculty found its truest

expression in substanti-al colossal works of utility, was
not fitted to achieve success in fields where subtlety of
thought or spiritual imagination was required. Roman

man indeed 3 but Roman literature draws from abroad

bring in a higher culture and more definitely Greek
