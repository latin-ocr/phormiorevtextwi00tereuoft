THE TEXT OF TERENOE.

The materials out of which the text of Terence is
to be reconstructed ln its original perfec- Text m atema le
tion are, roughly speaking, of two kinds: for ecruomc cc-

vm(l) the manuscript copies of the text, m'ry

ἰ ⁴ (2.) the references and quotations of early writers. As

however no copy professing to be perfect has reached

‚
a} ² us, we are obliged also to give some weight to the con-

jectures of medem scholars. And indeed many of the
various readings of more recent codd. are themselves
but the conjectures of scribes, and that too at a time
when critical sagacity was at its lowest pitch. By far
. the most copious and valuable source of evidence is
that derived from the MSS. Here we must draw a

⁷ ’ ⁷ hard and fast line between Ood. A [the 'flue codices.

Bembine] and all the rest. The extant codd. are very
numerous, but only' nine are thought by Umpfenbaeh
worthy of special collation.

Of these MSS. A alone is free from the recension
of the grammarian Calliopius [Tth cent. A. D.]‚ whose
name is appended to all others, V contains only frag-
ments of Andria and Eunuchus.

The Bmumm: codex is so named from having be-
longed to Oardinal Pietro Bembo in the codex Α.
second half of the xvth century. It is an uncial‚ and ι
consisted once of 14 quiniones: the beginning and end

ξ’ ⁴ however are wanting. It begins at Andr. 787, but is

much torn up to Andr. 888.
