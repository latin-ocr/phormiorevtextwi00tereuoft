491. ¹suo suat capiti. Guyetus says ‘ hoc non est uersus sed
monstrum, ab indocto atque inpudente interpolatore intrusum',
l buthe has the same kind ,of comment on 502 sqq⁴ and 508.
J Tr. ‘I am afraid our pander is patching up some scheme for
. ‚his own interest'. The idea in suat is taking on one thing t'o
- another, much as we‘ might say ‘piling it on’. This interp.

suat dolce, which is no doubt based on the phrase concuti
j doli (Plaut. Pseud. 540) and the word sutela (Plaut. capt. 692).

song '. There was a Gk. proverb fflfffffd ᾄδεις daga. Cf. Soph-
Aij. 292 ἀεὶ ὑμνούμενᾳ. ”

499. mpudentem. Bent. reads inprudentem, because inpu-
dens would be too strong a word for Dorio to use to a fi-eeman:
just as he conjectures inprudentia Hec. 213.

500. ut phaleratis, 850. Phalerae (from Gk. φάλαρα, Ρο110
