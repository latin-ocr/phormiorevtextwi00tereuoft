MAGMILLAN’S GLASSIGAL SERIES FOR
COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS.

Being select portions of Greek and Latin authors, edited

- with Introductions and Notes at the end, by eminent

scholars. The series is designed to supply first rate text-
books for the higher forms of Schools, having in view
also the needs of Candidates for public examinations at the
Universities and elsewhere. With this object the editors
have endeavoured to make the books as complete as possible,

- passing over no difficulties in the text, whether of construction

or of allusion, and adding such information on points of
Grammar and Philology as will lead students on in the
paths os sound scholarship. Due attention moreover is paid
to the different authors, in their relation to literature, and as
throwing light upon ancient history, with the view of en-
couraging not only an accurate examination of the letter, but
also a liberal and intelligent study of the spirit of the masters

ς of Classical Literature.

The books are clearly printed in scap. 8vo, and unisormly
bound in neat red eloth.
