74 P. TERENTI PHORMIO.

egit 1.. Ambiulus Turpio. The old reading was‘ 09 ere L.
Ambiaius Turpio L. Atilius Praen. ' But L. Atilius belongs to

a later representation, perhaps one of 13.c. 141. He comes
into the didascaliae of Andr. Eun. Heaut. (not cod. A) Ad.

Claudi, sc. seruus. Slaves were often very accomplished,
the Roman citizen disdaining all singing‚ dancing‚ dcc„ as in·
consistent with his typical virtue yrauitas. This is especially
shown by the ius uiryarum in histriones which empowered the
Praetor to scourge actors. Cicero (p. Arch ξ 10) contrasts
Archias with the ‘scaenicis artificibus? Livy (7. 2) implies
that these histriones were not citizens, could not serve as
legionamies, and became infames, nominally at least, until quite
late times. The sole exception to the rule is in the case of
Atellane fables. ‘Eo institutam manet ut actores Atestanarmn
nec tribu moueantur et stipendia tanquam expertes artis ludic‘nea
faciant)

tibis inparibus. We may conceive roughly the appearance
of the tibicen by picturing a man with two stunted olarionets
in his mouth. If both were dextrae or both sinistrae they
were called tibiae pares. The dextra had a shrill treble, the
sinistra a deep bass tone; these tones indicating the change
in the character of the drama. The comedy tibis imparibus
would imply a change from stataria to motoria, ‘from grave to
gay, from lively to severe', and this corresponds with the alter-
natione in the Phormio. Don. states the exact opposite with
regard to dextrae and sinistrae, but the ‘tibis duabus dextris’
in the Didascalia of Eunuchus, the merriest of the plays of
Terence, seems conclusive against him. Cf. Hdt. 1. 17 αὐλοὶ
ἀνδρήὶὶι καὶ Ὑυναικήϊοι.
