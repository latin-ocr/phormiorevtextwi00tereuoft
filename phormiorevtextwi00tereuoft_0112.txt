7 6 P. TERENTI PHORMIO.

uincit .- hanc ipsa profecto assidua ae diliyens scriptura superabit.
See Shuckburgh on Heaut. 46 in hac est pura oratio. Don. dis-
tinguishes oratio, in sententiis ,· stilus in uerbis ‚- aryzumentum in

gtssllg’ Tr. with Colman ‘ The characters are low and mean the

6. adulescentulum. On the u with which the word should
be spelt, see Ritsehl Proleg. ad Trin. p. xcv.

As to the allusion we know nothing. Terence’s litem-y
taste disdained any approach to burlesque. Perhaps some

such stripling as the Menaechmus of Plautus (as Wagner eug-
gests) is intended.

7. sectari. Frequentative verbs are especially frequentin

the comio poets: sometimes stronger than the primary verb,
sometimes not. Cf. e.g. infr. 99.

9. intellego, not intelligo. Bitschl Ptol. ad Trin. p. xcvii.
So Nqueyere, aequeparare are the right forms. See Mumo on
Lucr. 2. 951, 1025 ς· 3. 239—where he adds peremo, interme,

ῗὲῧεῖὶὶτ, recepit. See the note on Andr. 15 in Cambridge ed. of

9. quom stetit olim, Bentl. (reading olim cum stetit mua)
held that -it cannot be lengthened except it be contracted.
But profuit Hec. 463 [where Bentl. profuit immo uero obfuit}
Cf. Lachm. (pp. 75 sq.)‚ and Munro on Lucr. 2. 27 fulyet auro,-
5. 1049 sciret animo, both which Lachmdisallows. Nettleship
exhaustively treats· the matter in an E‘xcursus on the lengthen-
ing of final syllables, Conington’s Vergil, vol. 3. It would seem

thag25originally the quantity of -it final was common. Peile,
p. .

Stare used of a play having a long run—as in Hor. Ep. 2
1. 176 Q& an recto stet [abula talo.

 

11. laedo, esp. used of malicious libels, e. g. ‘Quom saepe

laederentur dabunt malum Metelli'. Afran. fr. 374 laedo
interdum contumeliis..

[The old edd„ inserted between vv. 11 and 12 a line et
magis placerent quas fecisset fabulaswhicu, out of place here,
evidently comes from Andr. 3. Being om. by best codd. it
was condemned by Faern. (Florence 1565)]

14. posset, so Bentl. [ἵ with E. see Umpf. ad h. 1.] for the
reading of the codd. potuissem prozoqus in Latin always
lengthening its first syllable, though connected with Greek
πρόλογος. So propino (προπίνω) in Martial; propola (προπώλης)
in Lucilius ; cf. prdpello Lucr. 4. 195; Ρτὸεεψίηα.. .
