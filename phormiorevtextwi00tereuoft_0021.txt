Fabula iucundi nulla est sine amore Menandrist.

‘ With an.— iteration which to some minds¹⁸ is almost
wearying, he tells us of the sorrows and schemings of
301116 forlorn lover, the artifices of his favourite slave,

- the anger or pettishness or niggardliness of his father,
Α the wiles of 1113 mistress and so forth. But there is

” , more in Menander than this. A pupil of 1116 great

, character-painter Theophrastus, a contemporary and

53. intimate of Epicurus, he was well fitted to bequeath
us a 'living picture of the manners of 1113 age, and,
better still, to give a lively embodiment to types of
character which are as universal as human nature.

-’ Menander’s plays are a study of the social life of his
time: they tell 113 how his contemporaries dined, chat-
ted, flirted: describe their piques, prejudices, little

‘ odd ways, their tastes and fashions¹93 and the life he

’ἱ ·draws is not so 'remote from our own that we have
any difficulty in placing ourselves en rapport with his
creations. Given a western civilization of developed
comfort, and» Menander's favourite characters will be
sure to play their part upon the stage of life. Men
