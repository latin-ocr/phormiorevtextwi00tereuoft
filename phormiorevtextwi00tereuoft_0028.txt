To accomplish this with success it is necessary that
each character be drawn out consistently with itself
and true to the principal· lines of real life. Taking the
Phormio as illustrative‚ we see Dorio representing the
ordinary slave-dealer, blunt, decided, bullying, a keen
and surly trader looking to profits and quick returns——
we see Phormio himself, a gentlemanly adventurer,

easy-going jolly fellow, full of the maxim ‘boys will be
boys ², and carried. away by his annoyance with his
