so long as youth tries to enjoy itself, parents are
anxious, old men querulous and unreasonable, women
seductive, parasites fawning and servants impudent,
Menander and his imitators will survive. An eye for
character, the knack of life-like portraiture·; these
Menander had 3 and besides these the strain of pen-
siveness‚ the undercurrent of musing melancholy, which
finds expression in terse maxims and reflections upon
human lifeffl.

This is the great master whom Terence set himself
Termes zan· to reproduce for a Roman audience⁹². In
‚quam one point at least he has, by universal
consent, succeeded: in charm of lang-uage he is second
only to his original: he has just that restraint which
most pleased a Greek: he is master of his words, even
when feeling is deepest²³z his metres are carefully and ,

⁴ skilfully handled, consonant with the sense, flowing

easily in narrative, and proving no check to the ap-
preciation of pathetic passages: so that we may safely
combat the criticism of Quintilian, who seems to think
that Terence transgressed the bounds of Greek se-
verity, for he says of his writings ‘plus adhuc habitura
gratiae, si intra uersus trimetros stetissent’24. Further,
his idiomatis: Latin²⁵, except in the occasional use of
γλῶτται (i. e. words transferred bodily from another

2¹ Notice especially ‘life is a fair’ in the ’Τποβολιμαῖοςι and
the1 well-‚known saying‚ ‘whom the gods love, die young ’.

22 In detail, the plays are: Andria, from Menander’s Andria
and Perinthia. Eunuchus, from Menander's play of the same
name and the Κόλαξ. Adelphi, from Menander's Γεωργός and
a scene from the Συναποθνήσκοντες of Diphilus. Heauton
timorumenos, from Menander's play of same name. Hecyra,
from Apollodorus and the Ἐπιτρέποντες of Menander. Phormio,
from Apollodorus.

2³ The exception to this is a tendency to pleonasm: see
ῃοῢξῗ, gasslmioblit Plato, a master of style, is pleonastic.
