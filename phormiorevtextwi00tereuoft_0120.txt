84 P. TERENTI PHORMIO.

Suet. Iul. 30 Et praetextum quidem illi ciuilium armorum hoc
suit ,· causas autem alias fuisse opinantur. Here it is opposed
to praetextum as true to false.

51. siquis me quaeret rufus—- Sentence broken off. ‘If
any red-haired fellow shall ask for me— ’.

The Romans being dark joked at the red hair of their slaves.
The actor who played Davus’ part would wear a red wig. Wigs
called yalearia [from their likeness to a helmet] were some-
times worn instead of masks (personae). Red was the conven-
tional colour for slaves, black for young men, white for old.
In this play we judge from vv. 209-212 that masks were not
worn. (HC-however Don.’s pref. to Ad. ‘haec acta est agentibus
L. Ambinio, δια, qui cum suis gregibus iam tum personati age-
bant’. When once introduced they came into fashion. Masks

'presented different expressions on different sides. Of. inf. 57,

was always worn.

52. conabar. Either esse or a similar word is needed to
complete the sentence, or conabar is used absolutely. ‘ I was
anxious to meet you ’. Don. mentions both explanatione.

em is to be distinguished from en and hem, with which it is
often confused in codd. Bitschl ad Trin. 3: ‘EmA: quam
formam cum iam in Mercatore—ut Plautinam tuitus essem
suscepissemque uindicavit postea Brixius et q. s.’ Bentl. had
already made the distinction in his Ter„ but it was ignored by
Fleckeisen. It is originally the Acc. of the demonstrative
pronoun is and is partly demonstrative, partly interjectional.
Ribbeck, pp. 29, 54. Α of Plautus (the Ambrosian) and A of
Terence (Bembine) agree in making the distinction. See Rib-
beck, Com. Fr. indeX‚ s. v, Em, hem, also Bitschl’s Trin.

53. lectumst. ⁸ ’Tis good money ’ (picked and therefore
good). Don. quotes a vs. of Lucilius, Lecti omnen Atticm

with which even a sum so paltry could be collected by a slave:
whic‘h] would .agree well with what has been said above
on 3 .
