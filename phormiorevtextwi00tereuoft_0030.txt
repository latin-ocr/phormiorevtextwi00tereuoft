accustomed3 there is propriety but no true virtue3 it
could do no good to the stern, steady, dutiful Roman
to see fathers mocked at and betrayed or themselves
indulging in the sins which they rebuked in their
children, to witness selfishness and luxury-sprospering:
decent matrons depicted as unamiable and uninterest-
ing, and always treated with more or less indifference
and contempt. The Greek always fied from the dulness
of his own home from his ·secluded and half-educated
wife to the more enlivening and congenial society of
his cultivated mistress (ἑταίρα). This was not the
Roman conception, and to make such a conception
popular by a sudden introduction of Greek morality
could end in nothing less than the slow but certain
degradation of the ancient simple virtues and morals.
There were two reasons why Terence would be
conrczuszom likely to have much influence: one that he
was a dramatist and could therefore affect more people
and in a more lively way: the other, that he fills a
great gap in the history of literature. Except Accius
and Lucilius there is no great name between the death
of Terence and the age of Varro and Cicero, a period
of half a century or more. Though not altogether to
the popular taste, he was sufficiently admired to obtain
wide influence: he is short, amusing and seldom dull:
he interested the more educated part of the audience,
and to influence them was by degrees to reach the
lower strata of society. When we remember the classic
style of Terence's comedies‚ the absence of all stage
decoration and machiner-y, the fact that the stage itself
was a mere platform, and that the spectators had no
scats but such as they provided for themselves, we
may well be astonished at the large measure of popu-
larity which he achieved. It shows that there was
sterling value in what he wrote: and though the mob

might sometimes hurry away to see the ropedancing
and the jugglery, yet the more cultivated could find
