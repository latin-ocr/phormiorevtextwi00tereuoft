INTROD UorJoNL xi

Slaves in those times were often of gentler birth and
wider culture than their masters: but judging from the
extreme'purity of his latinjty, unobscured and unde-
ffled by any trace of barbarism, it seems likely that
Terence was brought over in his early childhood: he
therefore owed to his master his liberal educati0n‚
granted doubtless all the ,more freely that he gave
token of future greatness. Admitted to the society
and close friendship of Scipio and Laelius and other
patrous of mark he had ,every opportunity for en-
larging his culture and achieving dramatic succeSS.
Detractors were not wanting to put the most dis-
honourable sense on this attachment of the great;
others, again, tried to rob the dramatist of his well-
earned laurels by insinuating that the works issued in
Terence's name were not absolutely his own, but that
he received material assistance in their composition
from his patrons. The poet himself seems to allow
that there was some foundation for this charge, in the

prologue to one of his plays¹⁰:—-

Nam quod isti dicunt maleuoli, homines nobilis
hamc adiutare adsidueque una scribere.-

quod ..illi maledictum uemens esse existumant

eam “laudem hic ducit maxumam, quom illis placet
qui nobis unium-sis et populo placent,

quorum opera in bello in otio in neyotio,

suo quisque tempore usust-sine superbia.

It 'is impossible to believe that these words of high
praise can have been applied to Laelius and Scipio, as
at that date they hardly deserved them: further, if we

adopt the earlier date for Terence’s birth, these patrons
were his juniors‚ and therefore unable or unlikely to

have helped him. Still the evidence is unmistakeable

that he received some extraneous help.
six comedies have come down to us: the Andria,
Ewnmhue, Hecmtomimo‘mmenos, Phormio, His works.
